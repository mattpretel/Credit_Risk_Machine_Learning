# Using Classification / Machine Learning to Determine Credit Risk

In this project I will build and analyze different machine-learning models to predict credit risk.


In the Resampling_Credit_Risk notebook I will perform the following tests and compare the results:

- Oversample data using 'Naive Random Oversampler' / 'SMOTE' algorithms.

- Undersample data using 'Cluster Centroids' algorithm.

- Over / undersample using a combination `SMOTEENN` algorithm.



In the Ensemble_Learning_Credit_Risk notebook I will run two different ensemble classifiers ('Balanced Random Forest' / 'Easy Ensemble') and compare the results.
